# To Do List App

## React App Installation Instructions
Begin by setting up your environment, following the instructions at https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. I am using the React Native CLI on Windows targetting Android. Make sure you have and are able to run the starter app before continuing.

Next, copy everything from the ReactFrontend directory into your new React project directory, replacing files of the same name.

Finally, run
```
npm install
```
in your React project directory. You can now run the app the same way you ran the default React app.

## Backend Installation Instructions
Begin by running
```
npm init
```
in a directory of your choosing to initialize. Copy everything from the NodeAPI directory into your directory, replacing anything if necessary. Run
```
npm install
```
to install dependencies, and then run
```
node index.js
```
to start the server.
