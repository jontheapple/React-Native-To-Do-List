# To Do List App

## React App Installation Instructions
Begin by setting up your environment, following the instructions at https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup. I am using the React Native CLI on Windows targetting Android. Make sure you have and are able to run the starter app before continuing.

Next, copy everything from the ReactFrontend directory into your new React project directory, replacing files of the same name.

Finally, run
```
npm install
```
in your React project directory. You can now run the app the same way you ran the default React app. Note that you may get an error the first time you try to run the app. I find that on a fresh install, I am unable to run the app until the second try.
